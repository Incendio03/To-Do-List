# Advanced To-Do List (MERN Stack)  

## Introduction
This is **not your typical to-do list project**.  
Built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it goes beyond basic CRUD operations by implementing real-world features like **JWT authentication**, **separate frontend and backend architectures**, and **secure user management**.  
While many beginner projects focus only on frontend functionality, this project showcases a **full-stack** approach closer to production-ready applications.

This is also **my very first full stack web application**, developed **independently** from scratch.  
As a 4th-year Computer Science student, I applied the knowledge and skills I gained from my **OJT (On-the-Job Training)** experience, combined with my **self-learnings** and independent studies outside the classroom.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Set up the backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

3. **Set up the frontend**
    Open a new terminal:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
